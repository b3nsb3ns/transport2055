# Transport 2055

Welcome to Transport 2055! This is my take on what should be built within the next 30 years in terms of rapid transit and passenger rail in Metro Vancouver, and to a lesser extent, the Fraser Valley and Sea-to-Sky. 

This plan is heavily based on real world expansion plans/concepts, and also the work of Reece Martin of RMTransit and the Mountain Valley Express Collective Society, linked below.
